First, be careful when using this script. Make sure you configured
correctly your PIN number and VPN before. Follow the STEP-TESTING
to ensure you got it right.

One other thing, OS X still gets confused with fullscreen applications.
If you run this script on a full screen terminal it might not work
because the focus isn't correct to fill your password.

For this script to work it needs some configurations:

  1. Your PIN saved into KeyChain app
  2. Assistive permissions for your terminal
  3. Correctly know which VPN service to use

Scroll down to STEP-TESTING if you already know how to configure.

CONFIGURATION

1) Using KeyChain to save your PIN number

On OS X (your Mac) there's an application called 'KeyChain Access' usually
under the directory 'Applications/Utilities', this is where all your passwords
and sensitive information is saved.

You need to open this application and add your PIN number to it so that is safe
and can be used by this script to retrieve your RSA Token. It's a simple process.

a) Open our KeyChain Access application
b) Click on the '+' sign at the lower left
c) Fill 'Key Chain Item Name' with 'rsatoken' (not your token but the word 'rsatoken')
d) Fill 'Account Name' with your username in your machine
e) Fill the 'Password' field with your PIN number

2) Assistive permissions for your terminal

In order to click in windows and read the results you need to grant assistive
permissions. Go to your System Preferences -> Security -> Privacy -> Accessibility
and ensure that your Terminal application (if you use iTerm, then
you need to add the iTerm app) is added to the list and it is checked.
If you see an error like when trying to connect:

62:115: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-10006)

It probably means that you didn't add your Terminal to the Accessibility list.

3) VPN service name guessing

This script assumes that you will have a VPN (IPSec) configured. It tries to
identify which one to use by listing and filtering. If you have more than one
VPN (IPSec) configured it might get it wrong, see STEP-TESTING to verify which
VPN service will be used.

STEP-TESTING

Before using 'connect' you can issue each command individually to check if all data
is available for running.

1) Ensure your PIN number is saved in KeyChain and can be retrieved.

${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} pin

2) Check which VPN service will be used

${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} servicename

3) Retrieve the token from RSA SecurID using your PIN

${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} token

4) Start the VPN and retrieve your token, test if you can successfully connect.
Paste your token from the clipboard into the VPN password window.

${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} token
${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} start

5) Finally, you can try go all the way

${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} connect
