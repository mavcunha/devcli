Usage ${MAIN_COMMAND} ${SUBCOMMAND} TOPIC

main_functions             It parsers all functions in ${MAIN_COMMAND}
                           and shows a little description of what
                           they do.

show_functions NAME        Similar to 'main_functions' but will parse
                           any subcommand or library by NAME.

cmdmap                     Information on CMDMAP feature to load
                           different implementation for the same
                           subcommand. It uses 'load_conf' feature.

handle_interface           This should be called by the general
                           command which behaves as a 'interface' for
                           different implementations using 'cmdmap'.

load_conf                  Function which loads external configuration
                           for subcommands.

twin                       Information about having a copy of this
                           tool so it can be extended to your project.
                           Without needing to actually copy and change
                           the ${MAIN_COMMAND} code.

CMDMAP - Mapping subcommands to different implementations

Using CMDMAP it is possible to map a subcommand to a implementation. In
the 'conf/cmdmap' is defined an associative array that tells devcli
to forward the arguments to another file. For example:

Let's say we have a subcommand called 'date' which formats
TIMESTAMP into readable dates, like so:

devcli date to_date 1234567890

If in 'conf/cmdmap' we find:

['date']='macos_date'

This means that 'devcli' will delegate the subcommand parameters to the file
'_macos_date' and that file has one implementation of 'to_date'. Now we want to
use the same command on a linux machine. Unfortunately macos' and linux's date
utility uses different arguments to parse a timestamp.

MacOS:
date -r TIMESTAMP

Linux:
date -d @TIMESTAMP

This could force us to have two different actions for 'date' something like:

devcli date linux_to_date TIMESTAMP

and

devcli date macos_to_date TIMESTAMP

Which works but is not ideal. The point of abstracting the details of some
commands is broken if we define different syntaxes for different OSes. Using
the CMDMAP we can dynamically decide which implementation we want to use. In
'conf/cmdmap' we can write:

date_handler=\$( __osx && echo "macos_date" || echo "linux_date" \)
cmdmap["date"]="\${date_handler\}"

In this case depending on which OS the devcli is running it will load different
implementations while it keeps the same interface so:

devcli date to_date TIMESTAMP

Will work in both MacOS and Linux. This example is implemented into 'devcli'
you can explore the files 'conf/cmdmap', 'devcli.d/date',
'devcli.d/_linux_date' and 'devcli.d/_macos_date' to learn more about it.

$(__less_notice)
load_conf CONFIGURATION_FILE

This is a helper to externalizer some data out of a subcommand. 'load_conf'
expects to find a file in 'conf/SUBCOMMAND/CONFIGURATION_FILE' and will fail if
can't find one. The file syntax is a bash associative array.

on the subcommand we call:

'load_conf myconf'

then in the conf/SUBCOMMAND/myconf file:

myconf["param"]="value"
myconf["another"]="other value"

back in the subcommand we can now:

echo '\${myconf['param']}'

The 'myconf' associative array defined in the CONFIGURATION_FILE will be
available to the subcommand that called 'load_conf' as a read-only variable. The
reason for be a read-only is just to avoid values being change indirectly and
causing confusion. It is possible to lift this restriction if needed. See
the 'url' subcommand for an example of this function in use.

twin - having a copy of ${MAIN_COMMAND} to extend for your project

The sole purpose of this CLI is to provide quick shortcuts for day to day
development. But projects are fundamentally different regarding their
technology stacks and team practices. So whatever is provided as default
commands and actions will not be enough for any sizable project and this is
where the idea of a 'twin' comes up.

A twin is basically the same CLI tool but with different subcommands and
configurations that are particular for a project. The main difference is that
instead of calling this CLI by one name you called it by another, and define
different directories for configurations and subcommands. For example:

Let's create a twin CLI called 'snap', the first thing is to create a symbolic
link with our new tool name:

ln -s ${MAIN_COMMAND} snap

Now if you call 'snap' instead of ${MAIN_COMMAND} you will see that it does
all the same things it did before. This is because is still reading from
the same directories. Let's change this exporting two directories:

export SNAP_CONF_DIR=/some/dir/snap/conf
export SNAP_SUBCMD_DIR=/some/dir/snap/subcommands

If you call 'snap' this time it will not show any subcommands (assuming the
directories are empty). You can now extend the behavior of your new tool by
creating subcommands and configurations as you see fit.

What about extending? If you want to bring all files from ${MAIN_COMMAND} to
your snap tool and only create new commands you can use:

${MAIN_COMMAND} twin update

This command will copy all files to your new tool and you can extend them and
grow your own CLI.

function doc_handle_interface() {
  less -R <<END_OF_DOC
$(__less_notice)
handle_interface \${@} - calling implementation from interface

When using the 'cmdmap' feature we need to define a subcommand
file like 'date' that will handle the call. This file does not
have an implementation of the subcommand but just works as
a proxy (or interface) for the real command.

In 'cmdmap' we mentioned that 'to_date' is the action we
will implement in a OS independent way. For that our
'date' file will look like:

function date_to_date() { error 'not implemented'; }

handle_interface \${@}

In this case we define that there's a function called 'to_date'
we expect be overridden by a real implementation of 'to_date', to
delegate the call we need to use the function 'handle_interface' and
pass all arguments we received to this function.

Note that the way 'handle_interface' works it will prefix any
function call in the form of 'SUBCOMMAND_FUNCTION'. So, in the case
of 'date' subcommand with 'to_date' function the real functions must
be called 'date_to_date'.

The reason for this convention is to avoid name clashing with other
functions and/or commands already in your shell.
