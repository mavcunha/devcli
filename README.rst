devcli - a command line tool to create command line tools
=========================================================

This is a draft
---------------

Developers have to memorize a ungodly amount of information

We create systems that are complex where there are lots of details such
order of execution and finicky commands.

The only way to reign over the chaos we create is to store our knowledge
somewhere.

How easy you can store information seldon corresponds to how easy will be
to retrieve it.

Information on how to build and work with a system should be close to the system
itself.
